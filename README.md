# Study & Chill ‚Äì YouTube Music & Tutorial Focus Extension

**Study & Chill** is a Chrome extension designed to help you focus while studying or watching tutorials on YouTube. It allows you to automatically control your music playback while you watch a tutorial  either by pausing it or lowering its volume so you don‚Äôt have to keep switching tabs manually.



## üìù Why I Created This

When I study programming, pen testing or follow a tutorial, I often listen to background music. But it was frustrating to constantly switch between tabs to:

- Pause or lower the music when I need to focus on the tutorial.  
- Restore or increase the music volume after practicing or pausing the tutorial.  

To save time and reduce distractions, I created **Study & Chill**. With this extension, you only need to:

1. Set your **Music tab**.  
2. Set your **Tutorial tab**.  
3. Choose how the music behaves when the tutorial plays:  
   - **Stop**: pause the music completely.  
   - **Background**: lower the music volume to a custom level.  

When you pause or stop the tutorial, the music automatically resumes or returns to the volume you specify. No more back-and-forth just focus on what you're studying!



## üéØ Features

- Set Music & Tutorial tabs easily with one click.  
- Stop or lower music volume automatically when the tutorial plays.  
- Restore music volume or resume playback when the tutorial pauses.  
- Customizable background and foreground volume sliders in Background mode.  
- Lightweight and easy to use.  
- Works only for YouTube videos (music or tutorial).
